# User experience and design
Apps are not just functional systems. A poorly designed app is no longer accepted.
Apps should care about design and usability. That is why we have design systems that 
help us with an attractive design and the best experience posible. These systems are a set of guidelines
to provide consisten design and user experience.

Some of these systems include:

- Bootstrap
- Bulma
- Material Design

Material is a system made by Google which has their design principles and guidelines. But in order to take
those guidelines and apply them to components we need a tool aware of components. That's where Vuetify comes in. Like Vuetify, there is also Buetify (Bulma) and Bootstrap-Vue. These tools are the design system plus the component awareness needed to fully integrate those systems to te modular component design pattern proposed bt Vue.
